# 🌬️ Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development

This project is part of a strategic initiative to evaluate the **market potential, user needs, and product-market fit** for launching a new line of air purifiers in India. The research is data-driven and leverages AQI metrics, health statistics, income levels, consumer behavior, and competitive benchmarking to guide the development of a product that truly aligns with market demands.

## 📌 Objective

To identify:
- The most affected regions and demographics due to air pollution.
- The correlation between air pollution and public health outcomes.
- Key consumer preferences, price sensitivity, and buying behavior.
- Gaps in the existing air purifier market offerings.
- Recommendations for product features, pricing strategy, and go-to-market plan.

## 📊 Data Sources

- **AQI Data** (2022–2025): Regional and city-level air quality trends.
- **Health Impact Data**: Age-wise hospitalizations and respiratory illness stats.
- **Demographics**: Population density, income levels, EV adoption, urbanization.
- **Market Data**: Competitor analysis, price segments, features comparison.

## 🧠 Analysis Performed

- Correlation between AQI and age-based health outcomes.
- Clustering of high-risk cities for prioritizing launch regions.
